Workloads such as databases often generate random write operations. These types of operations are the most expensive that can occur within a storage system and always result in a negative performance impact. This impact not only affects magnetic storage devices (HDD), but flash-based (SSD) devices as well. DataCore’s Random Write Accelerator is a mechanism within SANsymphony that organizes all inbound writes into a sequential pattern, therefore eliminating the penalties associated with random write operations.
